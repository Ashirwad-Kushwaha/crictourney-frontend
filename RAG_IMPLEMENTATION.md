# RAG Implementation for CricTourney Frontend

## Overview
This implementation adds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to the CricTourney frontend, providing users with instant, intelligent answers about the platform.

## Features
- **AI-powered chat assistant** available on all pages via floating widget
- **Comprehensive knowledge base** covering all platform features and technical details
- **Dedicated help center** with categorized topics and quick actions
- **Context-aware responses** with source attribution
- **Minimal dependencies** - uses only existing React ecosystem

## Components

### 1. RAGService (`src/services/ragService.js`)
- Core RAG logic with knowledge base management
- Simple similarity-based document retrieval
- Context-aware answer generation
- Handles queries about platform features, architecture, and usage

### 2. RAGChat (`src/components/RAGChat.jsx`)
- Interactive chat interface with message history
- Typing indicators and timestamps
- Source attribution for answers
- Suggested questions for new users

### 3. RAGWidget (`src/components/RAGWidget.jsx`)
- Floating chat widget available on all pages
- Minimizable interface with smooth animations
- Non-intrusive design that doesn't block content

### 4. HelpCenter (`src/pages/HelpCenter.jsx`)
- Dedicated help page showcasing RAG capabilities
- Knowledge base browser with category filtering
- Quick action buttons for common queries
- Feature highlights and usage guide

## Knowledge Base Coverage
- **General**: Platform overview and basic concepts
- **Features**: Team management, tournaments, payments, scheduling
- **Technical**: Architecture, APIs, database design, authentication
- **Security**: JWT tokens, role-based access control

## Usage

### Floating Widget
- Click the blue chat icon in bottom-right corner
- Ask questions in natural language
- Minimize/maximize as needed
- Available on all pages

### Help Center
- Navigate to `/help` or click "Help" in navbar
- Browse knowledge base by category
- Use quick action buttons for common tasks
- Full-featured chat interface

### Example Queries
- "How do I register a team?"
- "What is CricTourney?"
- "Tell me about the payment system"
- "How does authentication work?"
- "What are the different user roles?"

## Technical Implementation

### Simple Vector Search
- Text similarity scoring based on keyword matching
- Weighted scoring for exact matches and title relevance
- No external dependencies or complex ML models

### Answer Generation
- Context-aware response formatting
- Different response patterns for "how-to" vs "what-is" queries
- Source attribution and relevance scoring

### Performance
- Lightweight implementation with minimal overhead
- Client-side processing for instant responses
- No external API calls required

## Installation
The RAG system is automatically included when you run the frontend:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Dependencies Added
- `lucide-react` - For chat interface icons

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with actual vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Real-time knowledge base updates from documentation
- Multi-language support
- Advanced NLP for better query understanding
- Integration with backend APIs for dynamic content
